Open-source education materials for a week-long tutorial on high-performance computing (HPC) in chemistry.  The course is targeted at senior undergraduate and graduate students who should be familiar with at least one compiled language (C, C++, Fortran).

The course objectives are:
  * to introduce chemistry/physics students to the concepts, tools, and methods of modern HPC;
  * to enable them to start using and in particular developing applications for high-performance computers; and
  * to provide the resources and knowledge necessary for further independent advancement.
