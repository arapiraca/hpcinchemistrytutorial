to add files for the first time:

> svn add filename.ext




to commit files after 'svn add' or modifications to existing files:

> svn ci

all changes and additions, or,

> svn filename.ext

for a subset of changes (good idea if you don't know which changes you have made recently)




to get changes made to the repo:

> svn up
